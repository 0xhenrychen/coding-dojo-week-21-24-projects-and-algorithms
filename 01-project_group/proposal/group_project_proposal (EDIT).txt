Title: Beast Mode Gyms Booking Website

GitHub repo link: https://github.com/0xhenrychen/coding-dojo-week-21-24-projects-and-algorithms/tree/main/00-project_solo

Project name: Beast Mode Gyms

Project description: Focused around my passion for fitness and using a workout class booking app everyday (Mindbody and The Camp TC), I'd like my solo project to be something similar.

The "Beast Mode Gyms" booking website will allow both trainers and trainees to register and login (with validations).

For trainer users, they will have CRUD functionality on classes (name, date, time, and location). For trainee users, they will only have R functionality but will be able to book/cancel an existing class.

Both types of users will be able to update their account info and log out.

If time permits, there will be additional features, i.e. showing a list of all the trainee users that have booked a class.

MVP (minimum viable product) features: CRUD operations for trainer user and R operation for trainee user (login and registration validations).

Bonus feature(s): CSS Bookstrap framework and many-to-many relationship (one trainer can teach multiple trainees in a class and one trainee can be taught by multiple trainers).
