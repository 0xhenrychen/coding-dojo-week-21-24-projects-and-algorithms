Project name: Get Out Outdoors Social Media Website

Project description: After having a Zoom meeting, we agreed to have our group project revolve around a social-media app/website, i.e. Instagram and Facebook. We also wanted to incorporate a common passion among all of us, such as the outdoors.

Being that our stack will be JavaScript/MERN, we'll use React as our front-end JS library, MongoDB as our database, and Express as our framework with node.js.

We'll incorporate all the MVPs in our outdoors social media app, such as CRUD features, CSS implementation (most likely with Bootstrap), login/registration, and data-validation.

Specifically, we'll have users, i.e. outdoor enthusiasts, be able to create an account/log in, create posts including uploading an image and choosing a type of activity and view/comment/like other users' posts.

Bonus features: Login and registration with validation, protected routes, CSS Bookstrap framework, image upload in the post, and potentially others depending on time and difficulty.
