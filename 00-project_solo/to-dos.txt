- in dashboard, it's still showing classes that a trainee has already booked (mysql query statement isn't correct for get_all_classes_trainee_not_scheduled function)


 SELECT * from classes
                    JOIN joined_classes ON classes.id = joined_classes.class_id
                    JOIN users TR ON TR.id = classes.trainer_id
                    WHERE joined_classes.user_id != 2 OR (classes.id != joined_classes.class_id AND joined_classes.user_id = 2)
                    ORDER BY classes.class_date ASC, classes.class_time ASC;

- Add messaging functionality.

- CSS - stylize in bootstrap.

- format location, date, and time (how to reference the name)

- For trainees going to trainer pages, redirect them to a new page (saying they aren't a trainer)
